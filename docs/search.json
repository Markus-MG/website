    "section": "",
    "text": "The importance of civilian-combatant relations is well-established (Arjona 2016). Yet, we know little about how they are formed in fragmented conflicts, which are marked by a multitude of armed actors having overlapping control instead of exclusive territorial control. I argue that in such volatile contexts, political authority – a relationship of legitimate power (Agnew 2005) – is mainly formed through tangible interactions rather than through abstract institutionalised processes or service provision. Roadblocks are a central feature of this process. Their omnipresence in conflicts as well as their spatiotemporal and functional flexibility make them ideally suited to provide these interactions at scale (Schouten 2022)."
